For almost any person, there is nothing more important in the world than their family. I love my family too. Today I would like to tell you about them.
My family is quite big. It consists of my mother, father, my three siblings and our cat Bob. Well, most people would say that a pet is not a family member but no one in our family would agree with that. We all love Bob and consider him a family member.
